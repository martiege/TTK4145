TODO
  Change from using GenServer.cast in ElevatorFinder and event to use SimpleElevator functions?

  Add cost function

  Add optimization algorithm
    Execute cost function for each request

    Communicate which elevator takes which request?
      Might be solved if all elevators are quickly updated when the request is finished
        Ask for help
