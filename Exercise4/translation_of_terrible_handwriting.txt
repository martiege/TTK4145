Elevator guarantees 
	Elevator looses network: 
		Reassign orders (subnetwork)
		(order is fulfilled, redundancy)

		Try to reconnect
		(will not work alone unless necessary)

		Rebuild full order
		(efficient order distribution)

	Elevator looses power:
		Initialize hardware, software
		(elevator is working)

		Reestablish global and local orders, network + file
		(no lost orders)
		NB! not necessary to reestablish local orders, 
		this is concidered a major failing for the system
		and as such any file storage may be corrupted and 
		has to be discarded. Global requests (or orders) 
		must be reestablished

		Network guarantees

	Unforseen events => elevator unable to fulfill order
		Every system tick, the lowest order / request bid is 
		incremented, making it more undesirable over time
		(reassign elevators that are inefficient over time)

Orders (requests) guarantees
	Accepting orders:
		Self-checks, look for all clear
		(system should behave reasonably)

		Spam-filter? GenStage can filter...

		Answer garbage msg format by raising error on origin
		(stop faulty elevators from sending messages)
	
	Share entire state:
		State changes => combine state through set-like 
		behaviour, same process for offline -> online
